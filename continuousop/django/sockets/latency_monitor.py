"""
Monitoring a connection involves a constant, albeit light, traffic between
client and server. The current implementation uses a dedicated namespace in the
server and a dedicated socket in the client for this traffic. This scheme will
result in measurements of the round trip time (RTT) that reflects the best
possible value the real RTT will have for this particular client.

To implement monitoring a greenlet is spawn in server code, responsible for
emiting the "health monitor packet" every "health check interval"
milliseconds. Upong receiving the packet, the client will inmediatly bounce it
back to the server. The server receives the bounced packet by way of a "on_*"
or "recv_*" function.

----

The entire point is to measure RTT for each pair of packets, the sent and the
bounced. Sholud packets which arrive out of order should still affecet RTT
approximation? If not, a "sequence number" could employed to force order
in the stream of bounced packets.

ALTERNATIVE IMPLEMENTATION:
Use the callback function in the server side emit() to trigger a closure
wrapping both the datetime of the emitted packet, and the current approximation
for RTT.
This implementation involves less client work, and potentially less impact on
the network, since the client needs only call the "ack" function to trigger an
ACK packet back to the server.

ALTERNATIVE IMPLEMENTATION:
Move all this logic to the client. Let the server only bounce the packets and
feed from the results in them.
