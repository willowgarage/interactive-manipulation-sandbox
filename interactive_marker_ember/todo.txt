We need to bubble event to the correct Object3D view. To do this:

Phase 1
 - Get object (perform on every mouseMove FOR NOW (or just get mouse coordinates on mousemove and get object on render)
 - Bubble event to object (can they mixin Ember.View?)
 - Keep track of dragging, mouseenter, etc.

Phase 2
 - Create an Object3DView that every object has
 - Get view of object after the pick() step
 - Bubble events to object's view
 ? How does this work with compound meshes?

Phase 3
 - Create scene from ArrayController's contents
 ? Does it use Object3D or Object3DView ?
